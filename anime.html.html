    <h1> BEST ANIMES OF ALL TIME</h1> <h2 class="his"> <b> <u> History of Anime</u> </b></h2>
   
    <p> <b class="early"> Early anime (1907-1950s):</b> The first anime films were created in the early 1900s, but it was not until the 1950s that anime <br> began to develop its own unique style. This was due in part to the influence of Osamu Tezuka, who is considered the "father of anime". <br> Tezuka's work was characterized by its vibrant colors, expressive characters, and fantastical stories.</p>
    <p><b class="gold">Golden age of anime (1960s-1970s):</b>The 1960s and 1970s were a golden age for anime, with many classic series and films being produced during this time. Some of the most popular anime from this era include Astro Boy, Speed Racer, and Princess Mononoke.</p>
    <p><b class="mod">Modern anime (1980s-present): </b> Anime has continued to grow in popularity since the 1980s, and today it is a global phenomenon. There are anime series and films for people of all ages and interests, from action and adventure to comedy and romance.</p>
